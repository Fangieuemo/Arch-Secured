# Arch-Secured
a more secure version of arch linux

### Please Note
this repository will be archived until I begin writing code that will belong to the security protocols of arch-secured and may include an image of arch-securedOS

- [ ] Encryption to the image
- [ ] Self-destruction protocol (Proto-14J)
- [ ] Routing all networking through tor by option
- [ ] Having a way to contact everyone else via communication over matrix
- [ ] installed necessary things like lxdm desktop etc
- [ ] installed optional things (that are to be ran in SANDBOX ONLY) like discord element steam etc

### TODO-CURRENTLY
- [ ] Finish remaining tasks (modify the linux-zen kernel)
